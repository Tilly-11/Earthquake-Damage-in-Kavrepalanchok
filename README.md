# Earthquake Damage Prediction – Nepal 2015 🏗️

In this project we build a classification model to predict building damage for the district of Kavrepalanchok.
This project focuses on using real-world data from Open Data Nepal to build machine learning models that predict the extent of building damage caused by the 2015 Nepal Earthquake. The analysis centers on data from the Gorkha district—where the quake originated—with additional data from Ramechhap to enhance the model's robustness.

**📘 Project Overview**

The devastating 2015 Nepal Earthquake highlighted the importance of rapid, data-informed disaster response. By predicting the severity of building damage, this project supports more effective planning and allocation of resources in future emergencies.

In this project, we:

- Query data from a SQL database to access structural and demographic features.
- Use classification techniques such as Logistic Regression and Decision Trees to predict the level of building damage.
- Reflect on and apply ethical considerations, ensuring fairness and transparency in our modeling process.

**🛠️ Tools & Technologies**

- Python
- Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy
- SQL
- Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualizations
- Jupyter Notebooks

**💡 Ethical Considerations**

Understanding and acknowledging the social and ethical impacts of deploying models—especially in disaster-prone areas—is vital. We assess potential biases in the data and make sure our models are interpretable and fair across different communities.
